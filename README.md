My *AWESOME* vimrc and coc configuration file!!!!!

## OVERVIEW

### Vim plugins(using plug):

- vim-man
- nerdtree
- polyglot
- vim-cpp

- vim-rainbow
- nerdcommenter
- coc 

    Since it is suggented by the developers of coc I also use vim-lsp-cxx-highlights.

### colorscheme

- gruvbox

### Coc extensions:

- coc-spell-checker
- coc-snippets
- coc-vimlsp
- coc-sh
- coc-cmake
- coc-clangd
- coc-markdownlint

NOTE: the configuration for coc was just copied and dumped from the internet and could probably be better.
