    Since it is suggented by the developers of coc I also use vim-lsp-cxx-highlights.

### colorscheme

- gruvbox

### Coc extensions:

- coc-spell-checker
- coc-snippets
- coc-vimlsp
- coc-sh
- coc-cmake
- coc-clangd

NOTE: the configuration for coc was just copied and dumped from the internet and could probably be better.
